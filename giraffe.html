                <p>🦒 Key Facts About Giraffes:
📏 Physical Features:
Height: Adult males can reach up to 5.5–6 meters (18–20 feet) tall.

Neck: Extremely long, with 7 vertebrae (same as humans, just much longer).

Horns: Called ossicones – short, skin-covered bone structures on the head.

Coat: Patchy spots that vary by subspecies, used for camouflage and heat regulation.

🌍 Where They Live:
Native to sub-Saharan Africa.

Commonly found in:

Savannas

Woodlands

Open plains

Examples of countries: Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, Botswana, Namibia

🌿 Diet:
Herbivores – eat mostly leaves, fruits, and flowers.

Prefer acacia trees.

Long tongues (about 45 cm / 18 in) help them grab foliage.

👨‍👩‍👧 Behavior:
Usually found in loose social groups.

Males sometimes engage in “necking” (swinging their necks to fight over mates).

Sleep very little – often only 10–30 minutes a day in short naps!

🦁 Predators:
Mainly preyed on by lions, especially the young or weak.

Use strong kicks to defend themselves.

❗ Conservation Status:
Some subspecies are vulnerable or endangered due to:

Habitat loss

Poaching

Protected in many reserves and parks.
